TO DO:

Current assumptions: 

- pass the env to the custom game; 
- visualise the instructions
	(some error in execution -- the way some stuff was done)
- disable the visualisation
- enable the passing of enough env states that the demo can be visualised if necessary


- get 1000 demonstrations

- Get behaviour cloning; loss
