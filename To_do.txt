TO DO:

Current assumptions: 

- pass the env to the custom game; 
- visualise the instructions
	(some error in execution -- the way some stuff was done)
- disable the visualisation
- enable the passing of enough env states that the demo can be visualised if necessary


- get 1000 demonstrations



- Get behaviour cloning; loss

- Read the paper again
- Add the VAE loss

ICML: 22nd
- sat: bc today
- sun-mon: vae loss in 2 days; reproduce their results
- tue: generalising the environment
